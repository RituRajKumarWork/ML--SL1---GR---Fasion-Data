# Fashion MNIST Classification

This project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset to train and evaluate a machine learning model for classifying images of various fashion items.

## Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset, provided by Zalando, consists of grayscale images of 10 different categories of fashion items, such as t-shirts, trousers, and bags. It is available on Kaggle at the following link: [Fashion MNIST on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist).

### Data Description
- **Classes**: 10 classes representing different fashion items.
- **Training Set**: 60,000 images.
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images.
- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels, flattened to a 784-dimensional feature vector.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
